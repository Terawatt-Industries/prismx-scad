The Prism Reprap is an open-source 3D printer originally designed by Buback on the RepRap Wiki (http://reprap.org/wiki/Prism).

The original Prism design source-code was distributed for compatibility with Google Sketchup.  The code was generously ported to SCAD by Github's 'egenoup'.  The SCAD sources are the original fork for this codebase and can be found at https://github.com/egenoup/Prism-Reprap.

All SCAD files are in /scad folder.  STL files are in /dist.
